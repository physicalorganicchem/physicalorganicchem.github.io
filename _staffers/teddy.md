  Background- Theodore is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oxford, where he is interested in leveraging physical organic analysis to develop novel fluorination methods. Before that, he completed his B.S. in Chemistry: Synthesis and Chemical Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. There, he held multiple teaching appointments and studied both transition metal catalysed organic methods under Prof. Kami Hull and physical organic chemistry under Prof. Eric Anslyn. When he isn't in the lab, you can find Teddy playing Chopin on the piano, having a cold brew or coffee liqueur (depending on the time of day!), and missing his corgi Mari back home.
